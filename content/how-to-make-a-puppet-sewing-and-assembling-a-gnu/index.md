This tutorial demonstrates the process for sewing and assembling a professional, Muppet-style puppet. If you don’t know how to sew, it’s not hard to learn. If you have access to a machine and a mature individual to teach you, politely insist on lessons. And if you don’t have access to a machine, you can still make this puppet by hand. It will take a little longer but you’ll grow so much during the process.

If you are just joining us, you will want to start with our previous tutorial, [‘How to Make a Puppet: Pattern and Materials for a Gnu’](/how-to-make-a-puppet-pattern-materials-for-a-gnu/).

## Sewing the Head

Let’s begin with the head. Sandwich both pieces with the right-side in, then pin and sew.

Next, pin and sew the head to the mouth.

## Sewing the Body

Now let’s sew the body. The chest piece is an oblong. Line-up the “shoulder” with the top of the back piece, as shown below. Pin the pieces together along this length, then bend the back piece to meet the chest piece and continue pinning to create a straight line.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_080.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_081.jpg)

Repeat the above procedure on the opposite side.

## Sewing the Ears

Let’s move on to the ears. Layer the ear pieces on top of one another so that the rights-side are facing inward. Then pin and sew, leaving the flat segment that attaches to the head open.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_087.jpg)

Then turn the ears inside-out.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_090.jpg)

These are great little socks, but they’re not ears yet. To achieve proper ear-effect, hold the ear at its base and slightly fold the top of the ear over to the bottom and pinch it with your fingers. Then pin and sew. Repeat for the opposite side.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_095.jpg)

Sew the ears to the head. Insert them into the slit in the top of the head and line up the bottom, flat edge with the edge of the slit, as pictured. Be sure that the white of your ears will face forward. Using a needle and thread, sew the ears to the head.

## Assembling the Head

Glue the stiffened felt mouth plate to the mouth foam. You may find it easier to trace the stiffened felt mouth plate on the foam to create a guide for gluing.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_077.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_078.jpg)

Then glue the head to the mouth.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_145.jpg)

## Sewing the Nostrils

While the glue dries, pick your nose. Fold the nostril pieces in half so that the right-side is inside.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_099.jpg)

Pin the ears and sew, starting from the wider end, about a 2″ seam, leaving an opening at the tapered end.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_100.jpg)

Turn the nostrils inside-out. You may need to use a stick or pen to help.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_124.jpg)

Stuff the nostrils.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_129.jpg)

Using needle and thread, sew the nostrils closed. You may need to pin the opening closed.

## Attaching the Nostrils

Sewing the nostrils to the head can be tricky. Start by folding the nostril over on itself, as pictured below. Move it about until you are happy, then pin the ends in place.

## Sewing and Assembling the Arms

Trace and cut the rod pocket pieces. You will need four pieces.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_102.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_103.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_104.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_105.jpg)

Set up the arms as pictured below, aligning the flat edge of the “hand” with the a short edge of the arm with the right-side facing inward. Pin and sew the aligned edges.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_106.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_107.jpg)  ![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_108.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_109.jpg)

Next, fold the arms in half, right-side in.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_110.jpg)

Position the rod pockets pieces on the outside of the arm so that they are aligned.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_111.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_112.jpg)

Pin the rod pocket pieces to the arm and sew.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_113.jpg)

Now fold the arm over on itself again, pin it together and sew.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_114.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_115.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_116.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_118.jpg)

Now stuff the arms, but not too tightly. Leave them a bit loose so they will appear to move naturally.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_131.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_133.jpg)

## Attaching the Arms to the Body

Position the arms on the body at the “shoulder”.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_150.jpg)

Make a point on either side of the arm, marking the top corners.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_151.jpg)

Cut a slit between the two points.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_152.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_153.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_154.jpg)

Repeat on the other side.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_155.jpg)

Flatten the arms so that the seam is in the center of one side.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_156.jpg)

Insert the arms into the should slits and pin.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_157.jpg)

## Sewing the Head to the Body

Lay the head and body out as picture. Then insert the head into the body through the neck hole.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_178.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_179.jpg)

Align the edges of the head and the body, then pin and sew.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_181.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_182.jpg)

Turn the puppet inside-out.

## Dying and Attaching the Horns

If you used marker to trace the horn patterns, you will want to trim off the ink.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_134.jpg)

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_135.jpg)

Dye the horns.

![How to Make a Puppet: Sewing and Assembling a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_187.jpg)

## Adding Hair

Using a very big needle and yarn, add hair by sewing from the inside of the puppet and pulling the yarn out. Tie a knot in the end of each piece of yarn to prevent it from pulling out.

Learning to code can be monotonous, but it doesn’t have to be. New educational video series, [Daisy’s Web Development Diary](https://gumroad.com/l/daisy), uses puppets, stop motion, and paper craft to teach HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to kids. Join Daisy, the fiery fox and programmer extraordinaire, as she guides you through the skills you need to build your first website. Daisy’s Web Development Diary is the latest addition to The Hello World Program, an online collection of videos and tutorials combining technology and art to teach computer science, programming, and web development.

In today’s always connected society, we are becoming more and more dependant on the internet. We use it for work, play, communication, and education. Because the inner workings of web technologies are obscured from the end user, the system seems like magic to the uninitiated.

It’s not.

The tools necessary to invent and create online applications for and with a global audience are not only free and readily available, they are easy to learn too. The difficulty is in confronting a competitive, sometimes hostile, male-dominated industry as a beginner.

Daisy’s Web Development Diary is a friendly introduction to the fundamental web language, HTML. With a smart, optimistic narrative and video blog format, the series is specifically designed to appeal to girls. As computers become more prevalent in our lives, it is increasingly important for everyone, girls and boys alike, to learn how to code. Understanding how computers and the internet work puts you in control of technology and frees your creativity.

This ten part video series offers an in-depth look at structural and semantic HTML, as well as the the most common HTML elements. You’ll learn how to build a game board with the table element, create forms for ordering sandwiches, link to exotic locations, embed media players, and more. Each video is accompanied by detailed written tutorials, so you’ll be well equipped to make your first website.

Brimming with pop-culture, art, and literary references, Daisy’s Web Development Diary entertains as much as it teaches. For example, you may not know what semantic HTML is now, but you will after Daisy uses it to investigate Lewis Carroll’s _Jabberwock_. Conquering dragons, exploring the depths of the ocean, and advising robots about dating are just a few of the many adventures in Daisy’s Web Development Diary.

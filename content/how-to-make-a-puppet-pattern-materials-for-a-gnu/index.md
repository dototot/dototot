Making a professional, fleece and foam Muppet-style puppet is easier than you think. In this tutorial you will learn how to make a puppet with easily sourced materials. We use this puppet in our series, [Superusers: The Legendary GNU/Linux Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5BlhFw3OgbpUYL4zP4zM8Na5Q2TwQA_X). His name is Aramis and he teaches Linux.

## Cutting and Assembling the Pattern

Let’s begin by tracing and cutting the head pattern. I recommend tracing on the “back” side of your fabric. Not all fleece is created equally. If one side is more textured and ‘fleecy’, this is the _right_ side, which is the side you want facing out after assembling your puppet. Trace on the flat, or *wrong* side. This will also hide all of your tracing lines inside the puppet after sewing. You don’t have to use a marker. Chalk or pencil work fine, too. But if you do use a marker, be sure to get a lot of ink on your fingers like I did.

Start with the head pattern, cutting the separate pieces and joining them with tape.

Cut the separate pieces for both the Chest and Back patterns and join them with tape.

## Tracing the Pattern & Cutting the Materials

![How to Make a Puppet: Pattern & Materials for a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_017.jpg)

Let’s begin by tracing the pattern on the white fleece.

![How to Make a Puppet: Pattern & Materials for a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_024.jpg)

Trace the ear pattern face up, then flip it over to mirror the tracing.

Now move on to the blue fleece, starting with the back pattern and being mindful of matching the grain to the chest piece.

Trace the head pattern face up, then flip it over to mirror the opposite side.

Now trace and cut the Arm pattern on the grey fleece.

Now trace and cut the mouth plate patterns on the stiffened felt.

![How to Make a Puppet: Pattern & Materials for a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_053.jpg)

Trace and cut the mouth pattern from the foam.  ![How to Make a Puppet: Pattern & Materials for a Gnu](./puppet_tutorial_gnu_054.jpg)

The last step is to trace and cut the horns from the thicker, white foam.
